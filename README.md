# MortalityOfNations

Testing the atom editor's hydrogen data explorer extension.  

I gathered all this data from different sources and visualized it.  The datasets compare countries smoking rates and obesity rates with their average lifespan, with data labels to group countries by region as well as wealth.  Correlations and patterns can be seen by chopping the data up in different ways with different tools.  

Look in analysis_images folder to see the visualizations possible entirely within the atom editor.
